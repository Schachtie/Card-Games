	Once the user selects to play, they begin by
placing a bet of credits. The player is then dealt
five standard playing cards. The player can then
choose to discard any, all, or none of their cards
and redraw new ones. Once the redraw phase is
complete, the program pays out the associated 
amount of credits to the user.
	
	All hand ranks are the same as in standard poker
as well as the Five Card Draw game inside this program.
Hand ranks are ordered from best to worst as follows:
	- Royal Flush (10, J, Q, K, A)
	- Straight Flush
	- Four of a Kind
	- Full House (A Three of a Kind and a Pair)
	- Flush (5 cards of the same suit)
	- Straight (A run of 5 consecutive face values)
	- Three of a Kind
	- Two Pair
	- A Pair
	- High Card

	This video poker program follows the Jacks or
Better variation. The payout table is listed before
each game.
