		\___ Five Card Draw __/

	Once the user selects to play, all players 
agree to place a buy in of credits to create the
initial pot. Everyone who bought in is then dealt
five cards each. A betting round then occurs.
During the betting round, each player gets a turn
to either call the previous bet, raise the bet,
or fold. If the bet is raised, any players
who have placed lower bets must call to that bet
as well. Once all players have agreed to the same
bet or folded, each player is allowed to discard
and redraw any, all, or none of their cards.
After the redraw phase, another betting round
takes place. Finally, a showdown occurs with all
players that are still playing. The player with
the highest hand rank wins the pot. If any players
have the same rank, ties will be broken based on
the face value of the cards that contribute to 
their rank then any remaining cards.
	
	All hand ranks are the same as in standard poker
as well as the Video Poker game inside this program.
Hand ranks are ordered from best to worst as follows:
	- Royal Flush (10, J, Q, K, A)
	- Straight Flush
	- Four of a Kind

	- Flush (5 cards of the same suit)
	- Straight (A run of 5 consecutive face values)
	- Three of a Kind
	- Two Pair
	- A Pair
	- High Card
